# Text Studio

## Installation Instructions

## Text Processing Application
A desktop application that provides the framework for executing NLP, ML, and statistical techniques on text data provided by a user.

## Hackable
Every user has access to create "plugins" which support their own text processing needs or the needs of others in the community.

## Data Schema
A common data schema across all plugins will enable users to import and export data to/from arbitrary formats. Users can sequence text processing modules together to form text processing pipelines.
